## First Wrongly Traced Printed Board

## Retraced Board (Update)

> ![](Board_Image.png)

I tried working backwards, since I trusted the project. It was my first time printing and using SMD Components.

The Arduino, Switches & Variable Resistor is functional.

MSGEQ7 IC Chip Circuit, with SMD Components, was not working.

# Update

> ![](articles-max0419-09-msgeq7-mono-circuit.jpg)

I Re-Prototyped the MSGEQ7 Circuit with a different reference circuit - On a Prototype Board.

Completed the Project.

Will be Updating Results & Circuit.
